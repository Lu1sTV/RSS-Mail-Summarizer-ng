Summary: This article explores "No-Panic Rust," a technique for writing Rust code that never panics, focusing on its benefits for systems programming where C is typically used.  The author argues that eliminating panics reduces code size, prevents unrecoverable exits, and minimizes runtime overhead, making Rust a viable alternative to C for performance-critical applications.  Achieving No-Panic Rust requires careful coding practices, potentially avoiding the standard library and using techniques like `assert_unchecked` to help the compiler optimize away unnecessary checks.

Summary: This article analyzes Silicon Valley's shift towards the right, exploring the reasons behind tech moguls' changing political affiliations.  Three key factors are identified:  shifting economic conditions impacting profitability, the Biden administration's adversarial stance on antitrust and regulation, and a decline in Democratic appreciation for the tech industry.  Despite this shift, the article concludes that the political cost to Democrats has been surprisingly modest, suggesting that prioritizing good policy over appeasing Silicon Valley is a viable strategy.
