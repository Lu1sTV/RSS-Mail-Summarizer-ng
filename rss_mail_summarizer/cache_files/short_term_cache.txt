Summary: This article explores "No-Panic Rust," a technique for writing Rust code that never panics, focusing on its benefits for systems programming where C is typically used.  The author argues that eliminating panics reduces code size, prevents unrecoverable exits, and minimizes runtime overhead, making Rust a viable alternative to C for performance-critical applications.  Achieving No-Panic Rust requires careful coding practices, potentially avoiding the standard library and employing techniques like `assert_unchecked` to help the compiler optimize away unnecessary checks.
