- A speaker discusses a 100 billion euro special fund for German states and municipalities, noting that 5 billion annually is allocated for municipal investments over 12 years. He highlights that this amount is insufficient to cover the much larger deficits faced by municipalities (24.8 billion last year, over 30 billion this year) and does not address underlying structural financial problems, particularly rising social expenditures. The speaker suggests a simpler approach like increasing sales tax allocation would have been more effective than the current complicated process, which he views as largely for show.

- US officers observed joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises (Zapad 2025) in Belarus, where they were personally welcomed by the Belarusian Defense Minister and granted full access. This event, occurring shortly after drones were shot down in Poland, is seen by NATO allies as a significant sign of cooperation and transparency, with Belarus expressing willingness for dialogue.

- Russian drones recently entered Polish airspace, prompting an investigation and a response from Poland and NATO. Experts view this as a deliberate "test" by Russia to assess NATO's readiness and to intimidate, highlighting a new level of escalation. The incident underscores the urgent need for NATO to enhance its drone defense capabilities, as current methods are costly and inefficient against numerous, relatively cheap drones, and suggests that stronger signals, including tightened sanctions, are necessary to deter further Russian provocations.
