- This blog post discusses the implementation of faster Go maps using Swiss Tables, a new hash table design. Swiss Tables improve upon traditional hash tables by using a control word for metadata and SIMD hardware to perform parallel operations, reducing the average number of comparisons needed for lookups and insertions. The post also addresses challenges in adapting Swiss Tables to Go's map type, such as incremental growth and modification during iteration, and outlines future improvements.

- This article explains how to transport a USB device over a network using the usbip program on Linux. It details the necessary kernel modules, daemon setup, and command-line tools required on both the server (where the USB device is physically connected) and the client (where the device will be used). The process involves binding the device on the server, listing and attaching to it from the client, and then detaching and unbinding when finished.

- The text discusses how scaling a project by two orders of magnitude (adding two zeroes) necessitates a complete rethinking of strategies and methods. It uses the example of bridge construction to illustrate how each 10x increase in scale introduces new challenges and requires different expertise and materials. The core message is that success at a larger scale demands abandoning familiar approaches and embracing a beginner's mindset. [(click here)](https://taylor.town/next-two-zeroes)
- This article critiques the techno-optimistic view of AI, arguing that current tests of AI's abilities in areas like empathy, creativity, and conflict resolution are rigged to favor machines. The author claims that these tests often force humans to behave in machine-like ways, neglecting the importance of social context and embodied communication. The author concludes that AI's successes in these areas are limited to machine-like simulations and do not reflect the depth of human connection and understanding.
