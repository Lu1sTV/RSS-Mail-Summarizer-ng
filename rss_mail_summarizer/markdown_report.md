Many are afraid of being targeted for their identity or past support of LGBTQ+ employees, leading to the shutdown of resource groups and a sense of persecution reminiscent of the Lavender Scare. Despite the fear, support networks are forming to protect and advise those affected, with many determined to resist the administration's efforts.

- The author discusses their long-standing interest in file systems, from the early Macintosh to the introduction of Apple File System (APFS). APFS allows for point-in-time snapshots and copy-on-write clones, which led the author to create Hyperspace, an app that reclaims disk space by converting identical files into APFS clones. Hyperspace is available on the Mac App Store and scans for potential space savings for free, with a fee required to reclaim the space. [(click here)](https://hypercritical.co/2025/02/25/hyperspace)
- This library allows communication of small data amounts between air-gapped devices using sound, implementing a simple FSK-based transmission protocol with a bandwidth rate of 8-16 bytes/sec. It generates and analyzes raw waveforms, and users can integrate it with any audio backend by providing callbacks for queuing and dequeuing audio samples. The library uses multi-frequency Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) modulation and Reed-Solomon error codes to encode and decode data into sound, with examples and applications including serverless broadcasting, IoT, audio QR codes, and device pairing.
