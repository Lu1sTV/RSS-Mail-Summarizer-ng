- **URL**: https://doriantaylor.com/agile-as-trauma
  **Summary**: This article critiques the Agile Manifesto, arguing that it's a reactionary response to poor management rather than a fundamentally new approach to software development.  Many Agile principles existed decades prior, suggesting the field's inherent challenges are repeatedly addressed rather than solved.  The author proposes shifting focus from features to observable behaviors as a more robust metric for software development success, advocating for a more holistic and less pressured approach.
- **URL**: https://n0rdy.foo/posts/20250121/okta-bcrypt-lessons-for-better-apis/
  **Summary**: The Okta security incident involved a flaw in how the Bcrypt algorithm was used to generate cache keys, allowing authentication with a username and the stored cache key even with an incorrect password, particularly for usernames exceeding 52 characters.  This vulnerability stemmed from Bcrypt's 72-character input limit, with characters beyond this limit being ignored, and a lack of input validation in several popular libraries.  The author tested various programming languages (Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, Rust) and found that many libraries lacked input validation, highlighting the widespread nature of this potential security risk.

  **Summary**: The Okta security incident involved a flaw in how the Bcrypt algorithm was used to generate cache keys, allowing authentication with a username and a previous session's cache key, even with an incorrect password, if the username exceeded a certain length.  This vulnerability stemmed from the Bcrypt algorithm's 72-character input limit, which was not enforced by several popular libraries in various programming languages, leading to the truncation of input exceeding the limit.  The author tested several programming languages (Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, Rust) and found that only Go and one Java library correctly enforced the input length restriction, highlighting the widespread nature of this potential security risk.
