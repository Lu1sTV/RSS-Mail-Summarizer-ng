- mdq is a tool that allows users to select specific parts of a Markdown document, similar to how jq works for JSON. It can be installed via cargo, downloaded as binaries from the latest release, or obtained from the latest build-release workflow run. The tool uses a filter syntax that mirrors Markdown, allowing users to select sections, list items, tables, and more, with options for case-insensitive or case-sensitive matching, regular expressions, and anchoring.

- An AI model has been developed that can design complex wireless chips in hours, outperforming human-designed chips. The AI uses an inverse design method, creating randomly shaped structures that humans cannot fully understand, but achieve higher performance levels. While the AI-designed chips show promise, human designers are still needed to correct errors and enhance productivity.

- This is a list of software and ideas developed or maintained by the OpenBSD project, sorted by introduction date, including security features like privilege separation, stack protection, and address space layout randomization (ASLR). The list also includes various utilities, daemons, and libraries, such as OpenSSH, pf, OpenBGPD, LibreSSL, and mandoc, along with their respective authors and maintainers. Additionally, the project maintains ports of other software like sudo, femail, and Game of Trees. [(click here)](https://www.openbsd.org/innovations.html)
- The author argues that text labels are essential for user interfaces because icons alone often create ambiguity and cognitive load. They explain that while icons can serve as visual landmarks, text labels clarify meaning and improve navigation efficiency. The author suggests that a balance between icons and text is crucial for creating user-friendly interfaces that prioritize clear communication and ease of understanding.

- The author encourages readers to create their own personal websites as a way to express themselves and reclaim individuality on the internet. They lament the loss of unique, personal websites in favor of corporate, SEO-driven content that all looks the same. By building a personal website, individuals can have a space to experiment, share their thoughts, and own their content, free from the constraints and data harvesting of social media platforms.

## Education and Learning

- This website provides a beginner-friendly introduction to stochastic calculus, focusing on the intuition and derivation of Brownian motion. It covers topics such as discrete steps to continuous limits, defining Brownian motion, Itô calculus, stochastic differential equations, and Stratonovich calculus. The article also includes applications, notation, code for generating visuals, and further reading resources. [(click here)](https://jiha-kim.github.io/posts/introduction-to-stochastic-calculus/)
- This website discusses a math puzzle where the goal is to generate any natural number using exactly four instances of the digit 2 and mathematical operations. It explains how the difficulty and range of solvable numbers increase with mathematical knowledge, from basic arithmetic to advanced concepts like the Gamma function and complex numbers. The article references Paul Dirac's general solution using nested square roots and base-2 logarithms, and provides a method to express any number using four 2s.

## Politics

- The author reflects on the Ku Klux Klan's power in the 1920s and draws parallels to current political events, highlighting the importance of fighting against fascism. They focus on George Dale, a newspaper publisher who fearlessly opposed the Klan in Muncie, Indiana, despite facing threats and persecution. Dale's story serves as an inspiration, demonstrating that even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, resistance and perseverance can lead to victory, as Dale eventually became the mayor and dismantled the Klan's influence in the city.

- This fact sheet from February 21, 2025, addresses several key points regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including the rate of Russian advance, the state of Ukrainian cities, and the legality of holding elections during wartime. It also clarifies that Ukraine has not suffered millions of losses, that Europe provides as much direct aid as the US, and that European loans are backed by frozen Russian assets. Finally, it refutes claims of aid misuse and highlights Ukraine's repeated attempts to negotiate with Putin in early 2022.

- The US military is facing a crisis due to exhaustion, political polarization, and competition from multiple opponents with superior industrial capacity. Despite efforts to reform the military, the author argues that the true purpose of the US military has become maintaining ideological credibility and projecting an image of strength, even at the expense of warfighting capabilities. The author suggests that the military is trapped in a cycle of impossible trade-offs and sacrifices to postpone necessary discussions about the future and sustainability of the American empire.

- The Trump administration, spearheaded by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is dismantling America's scientific leadership by slashing personnel, programs, and agencies, which could lead to long-lasting damage to healthcare and technology. Federal workers warn that these cuts threaten the US's position as a global leader in science and technology, potentially causing economic decline as innovation is stifled. The administration's actions are reversing decades of investment in scientific research and international collaboration, jeopardizing the country's ability to attract talent and maintain its influence in the global scientific community.
